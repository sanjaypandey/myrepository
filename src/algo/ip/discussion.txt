1. I was started with the parsing of the file.
2. For each character I just traversing the file and putting the formate (like a.b.c.d from the parseFileDataStream() ) as I mention in the form of a.b.c.d string to the generateComb() function which will creat the different combination of the IP addresses.
3. On the basis of b.c string's hash function (getting by the strToInt() function) I am putting the all generated
   comination on the incresing sorted order on the list of that particular hash value.
4. I am dooing the same thing for the different stream also.
5. Finally  through getIntersection() function which is taking the two different hash's I'm just traversing and 
  finding the common IP addresses from that structure.
